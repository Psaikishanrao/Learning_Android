Sure, I'll include information on companion objects, getters, and setters in Kotlin. Here is the updated Markdown content:

```markdown
# Kotlin Functions and Classes

## Single Expression Function
A single expression function is a concise way to define a function that returns a single expression.

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
```

## Default Parameter Function
Functions in Kotlin can have default parameter values, which makes parameters optional when calling the function.

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String = "Guest") {
    println("Hello, $name!")
}
```

## Named Arguments
Named arguments allow you to specify the names of parameters when calling a function, improving readability and flexibility.

```kotlin
fun printDetails(name: String, age: Int) {
    println("Name: $name, Age: $age")
}

// Using named arguments
printDetails(age = 25, name = "John")
```

## Vararg Functions
Vararg (variable number of arguments) functions can accept multiple arguments of the same type.

```kotlin
fun sum(vararg numbers: Int): Int {
    return numbers.sum()
}

// Calling vararg function
val result = sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) // result = 15
```

## Class
A class in Kotlin is a blueprint for creating objects.

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int)
```

## Constructor
A primary constructor is part of the class header and initializes properties.

```kotlin
class Car(val brand: String, val model: String, val year: Int)
```

## Secondary Constructor
A class can also have secondary constructors.

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    constructor(name: String) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = 0
    }

    constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
}
```

## Properties of Class
Properties in Kotlin classes can have custom getters and setters.

```kotlin
class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) {
    var area: Int
        get() = width * height
        set(value) {
            width = value / height
        }
}
```

## Companion Object
A companion object is an object that is declared inside a class. It can contain methods and properties that belong to the class, rather than to instances of the class.

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object {
        fun create(): MyClass = MyClass()
    }
}

// Calling the companion object function
val instance = MyClass.create()
```

## Member Function
Member functions are functions defined within a class.

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
    }
}
```

## Inheritance
Kotlin supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from a superclass.

```kotlin
open class Animal {
    open fun sound() {
        println("Animal makes a sound")
    }
}

class Dog : Animal() {
    override fun sound() {
        println("Dog barks")
    }
}
```

## Abstract Class
An abstract class cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods.

```kotlin
abstract class Shape {
    abstract fun draw()
}

class Circle : Shape() {
    override fun draw() {
        println("Drawing a circle")
    }
}
```
Certainly! Here is an updated version of the markdown file that includes an example of using the `copy` function provided by Kotlin's data classes:

---

# Data Classes in Kotlin

Data classes in Kotlin are used to represent data and automatically provide implementations for methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `copy()`. They are commonly used for holding data in a concise and readable way.

## Example:

Consider a simple example of a `Person` data class with properties for `name` and `age`:

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
```

In this example:
- The `data class` keyword is used to define a data class named `Person`.
- `name` and `age` are properties of the data class, defined using `val`.

## Usage:

You can create instances of `Person` data class and use its properties directly:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
    val person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

    println("Person 1: $person1")
    println("Person 2: $person2")

    println("Are they equal? ${person1 == person2}") // This uses the auto-generated equals() method

    // Using the copy() method
    val person3 = person1.copy(name = "Charlie")
    println("Person 3: $person3")
}
```

## Benefits of Data Classes:

- **Concise**: Data classes reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common methods.
- **Readability**: They improve code readability by clearly indicating the purpose of the class as a data holder.
- **Immutability**: Data class properties declared with `val` are immutable by default, promoting immutability best practices.
- **Copy Function**: The `copy()` function allows for easy creation of modified copies of instances, promoting immutability and ease of use.

Data classes are a powerful feature in Kotlin for working with data-centric classes efficiently.

You can include this markdown snippet in your Git repository to document data classes in Kotlin, including an example of using the `copy` function.
## Interface
Interfaces can contain abstract methods and properties. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

```kotlin
interface Drivable {
    fun drive()
}

class Car : Drivable {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Car is driving")
    }
}
```

## Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface
- **Abstract Class**: Can have state (fields), constructor, and methods with implementations.
- **Interface**: Cannot have state but can have methods with default implementations.

```kotlin
abstract class Animal {
    abstract fun sound()
    fun sleep() {
        println("Animal is sleeping")
    }
}

interface Playable {
    fun play()
    fun pause() {
        println("Paused playing")
    }
}
```

# Example Usage of Concepts

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30)
    println("Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}")

    val car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021)
    println("Car: ${car.brand} ${car.model}, Year: ${car.year}")

    val dog = Dog()
    dog.sound()

    val circle = Circle()
    circle.draw()

    val myCar = Car()
    myCar.drive()

    val rectangle = Rectangle(10, 5)
    println("Area: ${rectangle.area}")
    rectangle.area = 50
    println("New width: ${rectangle.width}")
}
```
